# Elliptic Script

#### In either Javascript, Typescript or Python, write a script which takes a crypto address hash as an argument (currency of your choosing), and outputs a CSV containing at least the balance of the address, along with any other metadata you can find. Feel free to use any publically available resources to achieve this.

### To run script: `BTC_ADDRESS=$address yarn script`

# Elliptic Script

### In either Javascript, Typescript or Python, write a script which takes a crypto address hash as an argument (currency of your choosing), and outputs a CSV containing at least the balance of the address, along with any other metadata you can find. Feel free to use any publically available resources to achieve this.

Publish your script to github, and send us a link to the repo.

Whilst we will not be making an attempt to monitor the time you spend on this, please take no more than one hour.

In our work here, we generally have limited time and resources with which to deliver a solution. If you donâ€™t have time to do everything you would have wanted, document what you would have done had you had more time. We make these decisions daily and they make for an interesting discussion later in the process.

Moreover, we value your time and seek to limit the impact this process has on it as much as we can.

# Elliptic Script

In either Javascript, Typescript or Python, write a script which takes a crypto address hash as an argument (currency of your choosing), and outputs a CSV containing at least the balance of the address, along with any other metadata you can find. Feel free to use any publically available resources to achieve this.

#### Script creates a csv with the relevant address information, including the wallet balance, and a second csv with a list of the wallet transactions.

### Steps:

1. `yarn install`

2. `BTC_ADDRESS=$address yarn script`
